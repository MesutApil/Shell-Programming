# Shell-Programming
This is a simple shell script program. I had done it for practice as I was just getting started with shell script. User will have to enter 3 digits and the program will do the following: 
1. The integer arguments that are entered.
2. Sum of the 3 integer arguments .
3. Product of the 3 integer arguments.
4. Average of the 3 integer arguments.
5. Square of each integer argument.
6. Determine that each integer argument is positive, negative or zero.
7. Determine that each integer argument is odd, or even
8. Find the all odd and even numbers between 1 and the second integer argument.
9. Find the factorial of the first integer argument.
10.Determine whether or not the third integer argument is a prime number.

I have practiced using if else statement and for loop in this program.
